   These commands perform different type of kicks to a nick or group of
   nicks on your current channel. When "nick" is specified, a fast kick is 
   done to that given nick. If a nick!user@host pattern is specified, then 
   all matched nicks are kicked. Reasons are optional, the program will
   pick one, if none are provided.

   K   - Kick. Plain kick, matching users.
   KA  - Kick + IP Ban. Like a normal "/BAN".
   KB  - Kick + Ban. Like a normal "/BAN".
   KF  - Kick + Fuck-off-and-go-to-Hell ban (drastic host ban).
   KH  - Kick + Host ban. People from that host are out.
   KU  - Kick + User ban. Bans all users with same userhost.
   MK  - Multiple kicks. Kick one or more users at once.
   KBI - Kick + Ban + Ignore. Ignores the users you are kicking.
   KI  - Same as "/KBI".

   Edit the file "~/.lice/kick.reasons" to customize the default reason.
 
Examples:

/K mikh you momo!
   kicks mikh from current channel

/KB *@*.edu school sucks!
   kick and bans all users on the *.edu domain.

/KI *osek* you lamer!!
   kick ban ignores all users with the word "osek" contained in their
   address.

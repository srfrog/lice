Usage: REXC <#exception number> 
   Removes exception(s) for a certain nick or exception(s) for user@host
   mask that matches with pattern(s).
 
Flags:
	a	ALL. Removes all the exceptions in your channel.
	s	SELECTIVE. Removes only the exceptions you select.
Only one flag can be used at a time.
ie. /REXC SrfRoG		unexcs "SrfRoG", if online.
    /REXC *.edu			unexcs all *.edu hosts excned.
    /REXC *root@*		unexcs all root users excned.
    /REXC *anon?????@*.fi	unexcs host matching mask.
    /REXC *@*			removes all excs.
    /REXC #2			removes exc number 2.
    /REXC -a			removes all excs.
    /REXC -s			prompts you before unexc.

Note: pattern "*@*" and flag "-a" have the same effect.
   The third form of the command lets you specify excs to remove single
   excs by number or multiple excs if more than one number are selected.

   This command is only available on networks with +e channel
   mode support.

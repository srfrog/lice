Starting with LiCe 5.2.0, LiCe can now be installed globally by
system admins easily.

Regardless of where LiCe is installed, it will dynamically figure
out where it is and will be able to load all other files including
help system files automatically, once the main lice.irc file is
loaded.

Because system wide installs are often going to be owned by root,
there is no point having the /UPDATE function working.  You can now
easily disable the update functionality of LiCe by creating a file
in the LiCe root directory called disable_update.  If this file
exists on load, the /UPDATE function will be removed and the main
toggle of U (/TOG U) will be removed from /TOG.  This removes the
/update functionality.  You may wish to also delete the update text
from the help directory.

	Usage:	/ADCC PLIST [*|<nick1,...,nickN|channel1,...,channelN>]
	ie.
		/ADCC PLIST <channel>		send to "channel"
		/ADCC PLIST <nick>		send to "nick"
		/ADCC PLIST *			all channels you are on.
		/ADCC PLIST			same as above.
		/ADCC PLIST <nick1,nick2>	send to two nicks.
		/ADCC PLIST <channel1,channel2>	send to two channels.
		/ADCC PLIST <nick,channel>	combo :)

   Manipulate the status of the AutoSEND queue, and view all files queued.

   Announce your current channel that you are Same format as "PLIST" (See
   above).

REMOVE
   Remove one or all aDCC offer packs.

RESET
   Resets all counters and displays, including the status bar.

SAVE
   Saves your offerlist to a file, for later use.

SEND

   The matter of security also applies here, never do a command like:
   "/ADCC SEND <nick> ~/*" which sends all the files in your HOME dir,
   unless you know what you are doing.

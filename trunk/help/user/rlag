Usage: RLAG [server]
   Resets your server lag counter. Or if specified, checks
   the latency (lag) to "server".

   Q: What is lag, you ask?
   A: The term "Lag" is loosely used to determine how long your it
      takes for your data to reach the server or other users.  Compared
      to the theory of some 19th century physicists about
      'luminiferous ether', we find that ether and lag are basically
      the same :)

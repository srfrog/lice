Usage: REDCC [-q | <nick>]
   Redirect all incoming DCC GET's to <nick> via DCC CHAT.
   Repetitive assigns of <nick> will overwrite the previous setting.
   No leading '=' is needed for the assignment of <nick>.
   Use the "-q" option to stop redirecting DCC GET's.

Note: You and <nick> must be on active DCC CHAT for this command
      to work, and both must be using LiCe 4.

ie.
     /REDCC SrfRoG   - Redirects all DCC GET's to SrfRoG via DCC CHAT.
     /REDCC -q       - Stops all redirection of DCC GET's.

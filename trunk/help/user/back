Usage: BACK [-q] [message]
   Marks yourself HERE from a previous AWAY.

   It tells the last channel/nick you were in contact with that you're
   "back", if not in "QUIET MODE".

   The message is used to describe why you are HERE now :) if no message
   is provided, the default one is used. The "-q" is used to cancel the
   announcing even if "QUIET MODE" is not set.

   Edit the file "~/.irc/back.reasons" to customize the default message.

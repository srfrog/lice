Usage: UMODE [<-/+>user modes] 
   Changes your user modes, valid for the server you are currently using.

i = INVISIBLE
   Users can see the channels you are in if they try to do WHOIS on you
   (unless they share one or more channels with you)

o = OPERATOR
   Reserved for IRC operators.

w = WALLS
   You will receive any server walls. These walls are broadcasts of
   special server actions done by IRC operators (eg. SQUIT CONNECT JUPE)

s = NOTICES
   When set, all server notification will be sent to you, these notices
   currespond to actions done to users by the server or IRC operators (eg. 
   KILL LINK)
   Note: These are the "standard" user modes available in all ircii
   servers, additional modes may exist for modified servers.
ie. /UMODE +i-ws	removes modes "ws" and places you as invisible.
    /UMODE		displays your current user modes.
    /UMODE -s		removes server notices from your modes.

   This command handles note reminders for nicknames. The
   notes will be stored in a file and remain until you remove
   them.

   Notes are activated either manually or automatically (See CTOG
   and MTOG). When automatic, note retrival is activated by
   WHOIS, WHOWAS and/or JOIN.

   Options:
	-get	Get a previously saved note.
	-rem	Remove notes for the specified nickname/channel.
	-set	Creates or appends to notes. If the note
			doesn't exists it's created, else the
			new note is appended to the old one.
	-dup	Duplicates a note to another.

  Notes:
	When setting a note, the previous note(s) are not removed.
	You must remove these first if you want to keep the list small.

	Also, you can get and remove multiple notes by specifying
	additional nicknames. Yes, you can set note for channels, which
	will be visible to you when you join the channel.

ie.
    Set a new note:
	/NOTE -set SrfRoG I owe him $20 dollars.

    View a previous note:
	/NOTE -get SrfRoG

    Duplicate this note to 'ashee':
        /NOTE -dup SrfRoG ashee

    Discard all notes for 'SrfRoG':
	/NOTE -rem SrfRoG

    Discard _all_ stored notes:
	/NOTE -rem *

    Set a note for #LiCe:
        /NOTE -set #lice The LiCe Website @ http://www.mistik.net/lice

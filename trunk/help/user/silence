Usage: SILENCE [+|-] < nick | n!u@h pattern >

   Note: Only some servers support silence. This command will report
   if your server doesn't support it.

   By itself, /SILENCE will show you the list of n!u@h on your SILENCE
   list.  SILENCE means the server won't send you any MESSAGES or NOTICES
   from that mask.  You will still receive public messages.

   If you specify a nick without a +/- it will display the silence list 
   of the nick specified. You can only see this information if you're on
   the same server as them.
 
   If a + is supplied, that nick will be added to your silence list.
   If a - is supplied, that nick will be removed from your silence list.

   If a n!u@h pattern is specified in place of a nick, you will add or
   remove that pattern from your silence list.

Examples:
   /SILENCE                      - Prints the list of what's on your
                                   silence list.

   /SILENCE +DonG                - Adds DonG to your silence list.
   
   /SILENCE -bartgeek            - Removes bartgeek from your silence
                                   list.   

   /SILENCE +*!*@*aol.com        - Adds '*!*@*aol.com' to your silence
                                   list.

   /SILENCE Dave-PZ              - Show Dave-PZ's silence list, if he's
                                   on the same server as you.

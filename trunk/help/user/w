Usage: W <flag> [arguments] 
   Requests the server WHO information about a channel or users. If a

   about your current channel is obtained; if a flag is given, information 
   about your current channel that corresponds to the flags is obtained.
   If no flag but arguments are given, all IRC is used to collect the
   information.

Usage: SENSORS
  To change numeric sensors used by different protection routines.
 
  If you're having problems with very slow channel sync and find
  you are cycling from channels, set /sens c to 0


Note: if bogus sensor values are selected, the program's
      performance/protection will suffer. If you dont have much IRC
      knowledge, stick with the default values provided.

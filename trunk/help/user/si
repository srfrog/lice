Usage: SI [-f] [channel] 
   Display the invites for a channel. If no channel is given, the invites in
   your current channel are shown.

   The "-f" flags forces the use of server output instead of the internal
   cache.

   Note: this command is only available on networks with +I channel
         mode support.

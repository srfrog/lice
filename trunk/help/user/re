Usage: RE <nick|channel> <command> [arguments] 
   Redirects the output of your commands to a nick or channel. Even if the 
   command doesnt exists, this output if sent.
ie. /RE #LiCe WI
	shows #LiCe the output of a WHOIS request.
    /RE #LiCe MSG Vassago Phoenix is lame!
	shows #LiCe the output of sending a MSG to Vassago.
Note: Dont use this command repeatedly.

   This command is well known for its bugs, it's not very stable, you
   could end up flooding yourself or your channel if you try to redirect
   extensively complicated commands or commands that use WAIT states.
   ie. USERHOST, USER.

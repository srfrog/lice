Usage: PAGER <[path/]filename> 
      Allows you to view text files in your ircii active window.
      The rewritten LiCe viewer/pager routine is utilized (ie. /help).

      Example:
           /PAGER ~/ircrc.example
           /PAGER ./ircrc.example
           /PAGER /usr/local/lib/irc/ircII.servers
           /PAGER myfile.txt

      Known limitations:
           - Only one file at a time can be viewed.
           - '.' in the path is assumed as current dir.

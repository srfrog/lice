Usage: BACK [-a] [-q] [message]
   Marks yourself HERE from a previous AWAY.

   Use -a to return you on all servers you're connected to.  You can't
   supply a return message with this option.

   It tells the last channel/nick you were in contact with that you're
   "back", if not in "QUIET MODE" (MTOG Q).

   The message is used to describe why you are HERE now :) if no message
   is provided, the default one is used. The "-q" is used to cancel the
   announcing even if "QUIET MODE" is not set.

   Edit the file "~/lice5/back.reasons" to customize the default message.
   Or if you don't wnat to edit LiCe files, create ~/.lice/back.reasons
   and put your own messages in there.

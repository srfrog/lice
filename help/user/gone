Usage: GONE [-a|-q] [message]
   Marks you AWAY and tells the last channel/nick you had contact
   your new AWAY status.

   The message will be your AWAY message.
   The "-q" is used to cancel channel announcing.

     e.g. /GONE -q nobody will see my away msg ;)

   Normally, LiCe (EPIC) will put you on AWAY status on your current
   server. To set yourself AWAY in all your connected servers at once,
   use the "-a" flag.

     e.g. /GONE -a Gone for the weekend, bye bye!!

   Edit the file "~/lice5/gone.reasons" to customize the default message.
   Or create a "~/.lice/gone.reasons" file if you don't want to edit LiCe
   files.

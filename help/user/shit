Usage: SHIT -a <handle> [host]
Usage: SHIT -c <handle> <[+|-]channel|#*> [[<-|+>modes] [greet msg]]
Usage: SHIT -d <handle|pattern>
Usage: SHIT -h <handle> <[+|-]host>
Usage: SHIT -l [handle]

Options and Operation:
	-a	Creates a new handle in your SHIT database.
		If the handle matches the nickname of someone in
		one of your channels, their user@host will be
		inserted in the handle's host list. Alternately,
		a host can be specified and this one will be
		inserted into the handle's host list.
		NOTE: If no nickname matches the handle, or
		no additional host is specified, the handle will
		have no hosts associated. Then, one must use the
		-h option to insert/remove hosts to this handle.

	-c	Insert/Removes channels for an existing handle. If #*
		is specified as channel, the settings will match all
		possible channels.
		NOTE: A handle without channels will be automatically
		purged from the database.

	-d	Deletes a handle, and all associated hosts and
		channels, from the SHIT database. If a pattern is given,
		all matching handles will be removed.
		NOTE: a pattern of * will effectively remove all the
		handles and wipe your list clean.

	-h	Insert/Removes hosts for an existing handle.
		NOTE: Handles can initially be host-less this is
		only useful for maintainance purposes.

	-l	Lists all currently active handles. If a handle
		is specified, it shows detailed listing of the
		handle's properties.

Channel modes (for -c):
	A	IP ADDR: Bans the user's IP address.
	B	BAN ENFORCE: Will keep user permanently banned.
        C	COUNTRY: Bans the country or inet organization.
	D	DEOP: Deop users shitted.
	E	EXACT: Bans user with the exact pattern in shitlist.
        F	FUCK: Bans the user's host with a pattern.
        H	HOST: Bans the user's host.
	K	KICK: Kick users shitted.
        N	NORMAL: Bans with a simple *!*user@*host mask.
        U	USERNAME: Bans only the user's username.

Example 1: Group all those lamers that annoy me and kick-ban from #LiCe,
	   ban from #Linux.

	/SHIT -a Lamers
	/SHIT -c Lamers +#LiCe +KN go away lamers!!
	/SHIT -c Lamers +#Linux +N
	/SHIT -h Lamers +*!*lamer1@*host1.com
	/SHIT -h Lamers +*!*lamer2@*
	/SHIT -h Lamers +Vassago!*@*host3.com
			...

Example 2: Can't seem to get rid of this lamer 'asmodean', let's shit
	   his ass! We assume he's online (he always is), so the
	   script will auto-add his current user@host. asmodean can
	   be one slippery mofo, so we must kick-ban and enforce the
	   ban. We'll ban his exact user@host only.

	/SHIT -a asmodean
	/SHIT -c asmodean +#LiCe +KBE where's skuld4 you lamah?@!

Example 3: Seems asmodean insists on not releasing a new skuld for LiCe4,
	   off with him then! Let's ban his arse all over !!

	/SHIT -a asmodean
	/SHIT -c asmodean +#* +KBF update http://elfz.codehack.com too!

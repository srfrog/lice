Usage: FRIEND -a <handle> [host]
Usage: FRIEND -c <handle> <[+|-]channel|#*> [[<-|+>modes] [greet msg]]
Usage: FRIEND -d <handle|pattern>
Usage: FRIEND -h <handle> <[+|-]host>
Usage: FRIEND -l [handle]

Options and Operation:
	-a	Creates a new handle in your FRIEND database.
		If the handle matches the nickname of someone in
		one of your channels, their user@host will be
		inserted in the handle's host list. Alternately,
		a host can be specified and this one will be
		inserted into the handle's host list.
		NOTE: If no nickname matches the handle, or
		no additional host is specified, the handle will
		have no hosts associated. Then, one must use the
		-h option to insert/remove hosts to this handle.

	-c	Insert/Removes channels for an existing handle. If #*
		is specified as channel, the settings will match all
		possible channels.
		NOTE: A handle without channels will be automatically
		purged from the database.

	-d	Deletes a handle, and all associated hosts and
		channels, from the FRIEND database. If a pattern is given,
		all matching handles will be removed.
		NOTE: a pattern of * will effectively remove all the
		handles and wipe your list clean.

	-h	Insert/Removes hosts for an existing handle.
		NOTE: Handles can initially be host-less this is
		only useful for maintainance purposes.

	-l	Lists all currently active handles. If a handle
		is specified, it shows detailed listing of the
		handle's properties.

Channel modes (for -c):
	A	AUTOMODE: gives channel op or voice when they join.
		+A by itself does nothing, the users need +O or +V also.
		Note: automodes _dont_ requite password, use with caution
	E	EXCEPTION: allows the user to do the following:
			1) Deop other protected users
			2) Kick/Ban protected users
			3) Remove perma-bans
			4) Change locked channel modes
	F	FLOOD FREE: the user won't trigger flood protection
	G	GREET: displays a greet everytime the user joins
		the channel.
	I	INVITE: invites the user to the channel via !INVITE
	O	OP: gives the user channel operator (+o) via !OP
	P	PROTECT: protects user from others who KICK/BAN/DEOP
	R	REVENGE: revenges user from others who KICK/BAN/DEOP
	U	UNBAN: removes bans matching user via !UNBAN
	V	VOICE: gives the user voice status (+v) via !VOICE

Example 1: Add all #LiCe ops to an auto-op and protect list, no greeting.

	/FRIEND -a LiCe_Ops
	/FRIEND -c LiCe_Ops +#LiCe +AOP
	/FRIEND -h LiCe_Ops +*!*user1@*host1.com
	/FRIEND -h LiCe_Ops +*!*user2@*host2.com
	/FRIEND -h LiCe_Ops +LiCe!*e@*mistik.net
		...

Example 2: Create a handle for SrfRoG on #LiCe and #Linux. On #LiCe,
	   we want to op (no auto), protect, revenge and greet. On #Linux,
	   auto-voice and protect only. We know SrfRoG is online now,
	   so his current user@host will be auto-added (SrfRoG can add
	   his own hosts via /msg !IDENT later).

	/FRIEND -a SrfRoG
	/FRIEND -c SrfRoG +#LiCe +OPRG Hi there frog!
	/FRIEND -c SrfRoG +#Linux +AVP

Example 3: "Hmm... SrfRoG is a really cool guy, spending time on LiCe and
	   giving it away. The least I could do is give him ops in all my 
           channels!"

	/FRIEND -a SrfRoG *!cag@codehack.com
	/FRIEND -c SrfRoG +#* +AOPE frogs are cool! :)

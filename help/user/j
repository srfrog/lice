   '#' can be omitted. If the channel you want to JOIN has a key, this has 
   to be provided in order for you to join. ie. /J LiCe makes you JOIN
   "#LiCe" /J #singles,#chatzone makes you JOIN "#singles" and "#chatzone" 
   simultaneously. /J #lamers doofus makes you JOIN "#lamers" and assumes
   the key "doofus" is used.

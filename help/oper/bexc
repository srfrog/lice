Usage: BEXC <nick [flag] | pattern1 pattern2 ... patterns> 
   Channel mode (+e) that makes possible for the specified nick
   to JOIN your current channel even if banned.
Flags:
	a	exempts the IP address, eg. *!*@207.240.167.*
	c	exempts the country or inet organization, eg. *!*@*.net
	h	exempts the nick's host, eg. *!*@ppp-80.mistik.net
	f	exempts the nick's host with a pattern *!*@*mistik.net
	n	Simple *!*user@*host exc mask (default)
	u	exempts only the username used by a nick, eg. *!*srfrog@*

Exception types: c=country e=eleet n=normal s=site f=freebie u=username

ie. /BEXC SrfRoG			if SrfRoG is online. 
    /BEXC cag@* srfrog@* lice@*		multiple exempts on usernames.
    /BEXC srfrog@*.mistik.net *@*.com	exempts on specific hosts
    /BEXC SrfRoG!*@*.edu		exempts SrfRoG's under *.edu.

Note: IP addresses and hacked usernames are appropiately masked and
      marked. Only one flag can be specified for a given nick. When
      pattern(s) are used, flags are ignored.

Our BEXC procedure is smart enough to remove any conflicting exempts before
doing the actual marking.

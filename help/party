 The module 'PARTY' is a small-level implementation of a 'partyline'.
For those people that dont know what a partyline is: it's a bunch
of users gathered, via some abstract medium, discussing random topics.
Think of it as a little irc of your own.
The mediums used in our partyline are DCC CHAT and DCC RAW. Users
connect to you (the hub) via DCC CHAT and the chat is shared with any
other users currently on the partyline. More 'hubs' can be linked to
you and each others, making your partyline larger.
The partyline is most effective when the server routing is bad (lotta lag)
and you want to talk to a group of people, just make them join your
partyline via DCC CHAT or link their own hubs to yours.
Users on DCC CHAT jump to your partyline by typing '.CHAT' from the chat.
To load the partyline module, just type '/PARTY'.

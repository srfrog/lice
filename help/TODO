This is a list of random bits and pieces I'll be working on for
LiCe5 in the future. Feel free to email me, tim@muppetz.com
with any thing else you'd like to see!

2) Remove all compatability stuff in lice.epic5, or at least use only what we need.
   I have started on this. Moving to serverctl and windowctl...
3) Fix save routine to not rely on lice.epic5 (as above)
5) Fix help! - DONE! Needs cleanup work.
8) Update /ctog to support server+channel instead of just channel. [Hard]
9) Fix broken /adcc - Nearly. - DONE(?)
10) Update /noig to not display /ctog Q channels.
12) Fix BWord.
13) Remove dependancy on .irc -> move LiCe to .lice HARD
14) Look at the ONJOIN notify stuff.
15) Make tab complete work for HELP
15) Move everything into dbmctl (in progress!)
16) Add NOTE into dbmctl

This is a list of random bits and pieces I'll be working on for
LiCe5 in the future. Feel free to email me, tim@muppetz.com
with any thing else you'd like to see!

2) Remove all compatability stuff in lice.epic5, or at least use only what we need.
   I have started on this. Moving to serverctl and windowctl...
8) Update /ctog to support server+channel instead of just channel. [Hard]
9) Fix broken /adcc - Nearly. - DONE(?)
10) Update /noig to not display /ctog Q channels.
15) Make tab complete work for HELP
16) Add NOTE into dbmctl
